// Program Description: This program simulates two competing businesses trying
// to sell to 10 people. it simulates a decision of sales and other things like
// that. Happiness level determines where they end up and the simulation runs
// every key click till one person is left or 20 clicks have passed. Ending 
// stats are shown of the winner business with a smart ass comment of the world.
