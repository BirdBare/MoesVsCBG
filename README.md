MoesVsCBG
=========

Simulation of two competing business classes Moes and CBG.

This program was made for my C++ Computer Science class at missouri S&T. Anyone who is also attending is 
free to use it as reference! This Program Simulates two businesses Moe's Bar and Comic Book Guy's Store. 
The customers are partly constructed by with a random happiness and spending money. Which I am hoping to 
change soon for user input. The businesses are constructed by a file for items and prices and other things
passed to it. After they are made the Program runs through funtions Simulating entering the store, buying
a single product, then leaving the store. After they have left the store they shuffle around the street
a little then they either throw something at or rob another customer. And back into the store they go to 
shop and throw again. If they reach a certain happiness or depression level they are shipped off to
"Springville" where they will receive giggle treatment or be the administer of the treatment.

Other Details about program will be posted.....

Feel free to add to the project! Anything funny with appropriate change everywhere is great!
